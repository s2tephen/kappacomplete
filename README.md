# KappaComplete

A lightweight autocomplete Chrome extension for Twitch emotes. [Get it here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gldlaombdcbakndhnaahbhcaikdjkbek).

On any Twitch channel page, hit the TAB key in chat to autocomplete any valid emote. This works for both global and subscriber emotes. Autocomplete will only fire on strings of one or more characters. Keep hitting TAB to cycle through all matching emotes. You can still pull up usernames/suggestions with the @ key.

I'm aware that [BetterTTV](https://github.com/night/BetterTTV) has this exact feature, but I just wanted this functionality without any of the other bloat that comes with BTTV. This was mostly an opportunity for me to learn how to make a Chrome extension (and inadvertently, a thing or two about the Twitch client/Ember.js).
